### Technologies Used 
### :computer: :computer: :computer: :computer: :computer: :computer: 

#### :memo: HTML5 :memo:

**JavaScript (JS)** is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (along with HTML and CSS). It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.  JS is a multi-faceted, scripting language that provides versatility through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, among others.

**NODE.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that execute JavaScript code outside a web browser.  NODE.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.  NODE.js represents a "Javascript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different programming languages for server- and client-side scripts.

#### :satellite: Express.js :satellite:

**Express.js** is a minimal and flexible NODE.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.  The myriad HTTP utility methods and middleware allow for the creation of a robust API.  Express.js provides a thin layer of fundamental features, without obscuring NODE.js features.

### :vertical_traffic_light: React.js :vertical_traffic_light:

**React.js** is an open-source, front-end, JavaScript library for building user interface components. React.js can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.  It is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM.
